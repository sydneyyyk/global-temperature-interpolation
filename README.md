# Global Temperature Trend Modeling Using Interpolation and Regression

This project models global temperature trends using interpolation and regression techniques. Linear and Cubic Spline interpolation were compared to reconstruct missing data. The output was evaluated using RMSE. A quadratic regression model was applied to analyze patterns of the temperature rise and predict future temperature trends.

## Objective
- Determine the best interpolation method for reconstructing missing temperature data.
- Evaluate the trend of global temperature.
- Forecast future temperature levels using regression modeling.

## Results
- Cubic Spline interpolation achieved lower RMSE (0.47°C) compared to Linear interpolation (0.81°C).
- Quadratic regression provides better fit than linear regression.
- Projected global mean temperature in 2050 is approximately 10.3°C.
